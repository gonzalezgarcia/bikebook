# EEG Preprocessing

EEG (Electroencephalography) is a technique used to measure electrical activity in the brain. It provides valuable insights into brain function and is widely used in neuroscience research and clinical applications.

However, raw EEG data often contains various artifacts and noise that can interfere with the analysis and interpretation of the signals. EEG preprocessing refers to a series of steps and techniques used to clean and enhance the raw EEG data before further analysis.

In this document, we will explore the different aspects of EEG preprocessing, including artifact removal, filtering, referencing, and segmentation. We will discuss the common challenges faced during preprocessing and the methods used to address them.

Whether you are a researcher, a clinician, or a student working with EEG data, understanding the principles and techniques of EEG preprocessing is essential for obtaining reliable and meaningful results.

Let's dive into the world of EEG preprocessing and learn how to prepare EEG data for analysis!
