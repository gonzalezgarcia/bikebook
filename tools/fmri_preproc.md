# fMRI Preprocessing

fMRI (functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging) is a widely used neuroimaging technique that allows researchers to study brain activity by measuring changes in blood flow. Before analyzing fMRI data, it is important to preprocess the data to correct for various artifacts and improve the quality of the data.

In this guide, we will walk you through the steps involved in fMRI preprocessing. We will cover the following topics:

1. Data acquisition and conversion: We will discuss the process of acquiring fMRI data and converting it into a suitable format for preprocessing.

2. Motion correction: We will explore techniques to correct for motion artifacts that can occur during fMRI scanning.

3. Slice timing correction: We will explain how to correct for differences in acquisition time between slices in a volume.

4. Spatial normalization: We will demonstrate how to align fMRI data to a standard anatomical template.

5. Smoothing: We will discuss the process of spatially smoothing fMRI data to improve signal-to-noise ratio.

6. Temporal filtering: We will cover techniques to remove unwanted noise from the fMRI data.

7. Artifact detection and removal: We will explore methods to identify and remove artifacts such as spikes and physiological noise.

By the end of this guide, you will have a good understanding of the preprocessing steps involved in fMRI data analysis and be ready to move on to further analysis and interpretation.
